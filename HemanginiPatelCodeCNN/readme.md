### How to train CNN
 
There are number of ways you can train a CNN. If you are working with unlabeled data, you can use unsupervised learning methods. One of the best popular ways of doing this is autoencoders. This allows you to squeeze data in a space with low dimensions, performing calculations in the first part of the CNN. Once this is done, youâ€™ll then need to reconstruct with additional layers that up sample the data you have.  

#### Setup Information
### Dataset
> The training and testing dataset can be found under the "data" folder
> For the example of the ipynb my files are saved in a google drive folder at
	"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Artificial Intelligence/Data/dataset"
> To run the same .ipynb file, you must download the data and create a similar directory structure.

The dataset has been obtained from Kaggle with the dataset called Real and Fake Face Detection. It has
been published by the Computational Intelligence and Photography Lab. Department of Computer Science, Yonsei University
